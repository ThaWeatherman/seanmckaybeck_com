    <h1 class="title"> Unnecessary Censorship</h1>
    <p class=date> Apr 04, 2014 </p>
    <p>The <a href="http://ifea.net/cipa.pdf">Children's Internet Protection Act</a> passed into law in the year 2000. Its purpose is to protect minors from sexually explicit content online while at a library. While this is a good cause the methods required to enforce the law are ineffective and lead to many negative side effects. </p>
<h2>Filters</h2>
<p>Filters are ineffective at protecting minors from harmful content. An example of this is Google's Safe Search. I always have Safe Search enabled, especially when searching for images. I have done searches for the most innocent of things and still had a naked woman pop up. Even Google can't get filtering perfectly right! </p>
<p>Filters often block false positives. The simplest of filters use keyword matching which will more times than not lead to perfectly acceptable articles or websites being blocked. The recently implemented porn filters in the UK <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/uk-porn-filter-blocks-legitimate-file-sharing-services-and-torrentfreak-140103/">blocked content</a> from legitimate websites, including the download page for the Fedora operating system! As far as I can tell there is nothing explicit about an operating system. </p>
<h2>Harmful to Minors</h2>
<p>The definition of "harmful to minors" in the law is overly broad. Parts A and B of the definition are specific to porn, which I have no contention with. There really is no reason to watch porn at a public library. But part C is what worries me. It states that images which "taken as a whole, [lack] serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value as to minors" should be blocked as well. What qualifies as an image lacking in "literary, artistic, political, or scientific value"? Who makes the decision that the content is lacking? This broad definition of harmful content can easily be used to filter legitimate, constitutionally protected content. </p>
<h2>Circumventing Filtering</h2>
<p>It does not take a genius to circumvent filtering. When I was 15 I used a proxy to access flash games on school computers without any hassle. No matter how good of a filter you use a minor can find a simple solution to getting around it. This ease of circumvention makes the filter useless. The filter becomes a <strong><em>waste</em></strong> of resources that would be better spent on new books or additions to the library. Setting up and maintaining a filter is a huge cost to the library and a poor allocation of time. Those who intend to access this harmful content will find a way around the filter while those who have no intent to access harmful content will be barred from the legitimate content they seek. </p>
<h2>Public Access</h2>
<p>Public libraries serve as access portals to information. Millions of people here in the USA do not have an internet connection at home, and thus they rely on publicly available connections to access content online. Blocking acceptable content or web services restricts these people's access to resources that may be beneficial to them. Content blocking is in direct opposition to the kind of free access to information libraries should provide. </p>
<p>This law does more harm than good. In the interest of free access to information it should be fixed or undone. </p>
