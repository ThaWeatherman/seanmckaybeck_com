    <h1 class="title"> Review of Coinbase</h1>
    <p class=date> Jun 02, 2014 </p>
    <p><img alt="" src="https://coinbase.com/assets/logos/coinbase_logo_white.png" /></p>
<p>After an unresponsive buy request on <a href="https://localbitcoins.com">Local Bitcoins</a> I decided to go looking for a faster solution to scratch my Bitcoin itch. There are a lot of different exchanges running where you can exchange fiat currency for Bitcoin, but most of them require you fund your account with fiat before you can purchase your Bitcoin. However Coinbase lets you link your bank account then purchase Bitcoin without funding the account in advance with fiat. This saves you missing an opportunity to buy in at a desired price. </p>
<h2>Account Setup</h2>
<p>Setting up my account took less than ten minutes. I signed up with my .edu email address and Coinbase gave me 10 USD worth of Bitcoin. </p>
<p>Linking my bank account required the account number, the routing number, and the type of account it is. As expected Coinbase also wants to verify that it is indeed your bank account information being entered. The typical method for doing this requires depositing a small amount of money into the account, waiting 2-3 days for the money to transfer, then reporting the amount deposited back to the depositer. This method is not the fastest but it works. Coinbase lets you go this route. However they also have a much faster route. Coinbase allows you to sign into your bank account through them to verify you own the account. This method is obviously fast but also obviously risky from a trust perspective. I trusted Coinbase enough to do it and nothing bad has happened. </p>
<p>In order to be fully verified as a Tier 1 user you must also verify your email address (a confirmation email) and your phone number. The phone number is to allow for two-factor authentication of your account. It is basically forced two-factor authentication which I actually like for a service like this. Once you have completed all of this you can begin purchasing Bitcoin. </p>

<h2>Purchasing</h2>
<p>On Coinbase you select the amount of Bitcoin you wish to purchase and it locks in your purchase at the current price per Bitcoin. They then initiate a wire transfer with your linked bank account. You do not recieve the Bitcoins until the wire transfer completes so they are protected from fraud. </p>
<p>Because it is an ACH transfer the speed with which the payment is processed depends on your bank. The transfers typically take 2-3 days. After payment is recieved Coinbase takes one day before releasing your Bitcoins. This is because ACH transfers are reversible within a day of the transfer completing. </p>
<p>If you link your credit card to your account along with your bank account Coinbase will let you do instant buy orders. Depending on your level of verification you can only buy a certain amount per week instantly. After linking my credit card and bank account I am allowed to buy 100 USD worth. The bank transfer still takes a few days to go through, but if you absolutely need to have some Bitcoin now this is a nice option. </p>
<p>Depending on your level of verification you can buy different amounts each day. If your bank account and credit card are linked to your account you can buy 3000 USD worth of Bitcoin each day. Coinbase requires that your first Bitcoin purchase fully completes before you can make purchase orders whenever you want. Because I made my first purchase on a Friday night at 5:30 PM over a holiday weekend it took until the next Friday to get my purchased Bitcoins. It still only took 4 business days to get my coins though so it held to the estimation on my order completion. </p>
<h2>Selling</h2>
<p>Selling Bitcoin is just as easy as buying it. I only sold a small amount just to test it out, but the interface is the same. You select how many Bitcoin you want to sell at the current price and Coinbase deposits the money into your bank account. It's that simple. </p>
<h2>All the Rest</h2>
<p>The mobile app for Android works fantastically. It has functionality for everything in the web interface except for verification. <strike>There is no iOS app in the App Store but that is because Apple does not allow any Bitcoin related apps into its store.</strike> Actually apparently they will allow them now according to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/appstore/resources/approval/guidelines.html">section 11.17</a> of the App Store guidelines. </p>
<p>The support team is very responsive. I contacted them on a Saturday morning and they responded within 30 minutes. They have effectively answered my questions each time I have contacted them. </p>
<p>Coinbase allows you to put donation or pay-with-bitcoin buttons on your website as well. You choose what you want it to say and suggested amounts and Coinbase generates the code for you. I set one up on my <a href="https://seanmckaybeck.com/about/">about page</a> and it works great. </p>
<p>I only have one issue with Coinbase. It would be great if Coinbase allowed for specifying buy/sell amounts in USD instead of just in BTC. Sometimes I have a specific amount of USD I want to buy with. By only being allowed to specify amounts in BTC I have to do a guess-and-check on amounts until I get the amount in USD I want to spend. Hopefully Coinbase will allow for this functionality in the future. </p>
<p>Overall I would say Coinbase is an excellent choice for the purchasing of Bitcoins. From the perspective of keeping how many coins you have a secret Coinbase should not be your first choice. If that is what you care about then go to <a href="https://localbitcoins.com">Local Bitcoins</a> or #bitcoin-otc on Freenode. Coinbase is a great place for a beginner to the world of Bitcoin to start. </p>
