    <h1 class="title"> Getting Started with Bitcoin</h1>
    <p class=date> May 21, 2014 </p>
    <p>If you are new to Bitcoin you probably have no idea what you are doing. What is a wallet? What is the blockchain? What is an address? I am going to try and dumb all of that down for you and focus on the non-technical essentials. </p>
<h2>Wallets</h2>
<p>A wallet is used to keep track of your bitcoins. It handles what are called your public and private keys. The private key is the key to all your coins. If it is compromised your coins are gone. If you lose it your coins will be inaccessible and not recoverable. The public address is what people use to send you bitcoins. </p>
<p>There are lots of different wallets you can use. For those who have lots of space on their computers there is <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/download">Bitcoin-Qt</a>. For Android users there is Mycelium (and others). For the rest of you there are online wallet services like <a href="https://blockchain.info">blockchain.info</a> or <a href="https://coinbase.com">Coinbase</a>. </p>
<p>I like keeping my funds with me and I am on Android so I use Mycelium. I will walk you through the simple process of setting up your wallet. </p>
<p>First slide to the far left pane and at the top you will see a button along the top for adding a new key. Click it and you will see this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jj9IrKV.png" width="250px"/>
If you do not have a backup to import then click on "Random". If you are importing an existing key click "Scan". </p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ArssibV.png" width="250px"/>
After you click "Random" you will see this screen showing your new address. This is what you will give to people during transactions. </p>

Give your address a special name if you want. This can help distinguish addresses if you use multiple. </p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lJrivGO.png" width="250px"/>
After this you will be taken back to your home screen. Notice the warning. You can click it and you should be taken to a screen like the following: </p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9orrjAP.png" width="250px"/>
Click on backup. After this just follow the steps (it would not let me take screenshots). This will create a PDF backup of your wallet. In case your phone is ever wiped you can restore the key into Mycelium. You will be shown a key and it will be the <strong>only</strong> time you see it. Write it down or something. I use a password manager so I put it in there. After that click the "Share" button and choose where to save your PDF. </p>
<p>After creating your backup you should verify that the backup works properly. Scroll all the way back to the left again and follow the steps for verifying your backup. It will require scanning a QR code and entering that password from earlier, so do it next to your home computer. </p>
<p>Scroll through the other windows in Mycelium. There is one for all transactions with your selected wallet and another for saved addresses. </p>
<h2>Cloud Storage for Backups</h2>
<p>The backup process creates a PDF that needs to be saved somewhere. I have an account with a cloud storage service called <a href="mega.co.nz">Mega</a>. The free accounts with them give 50 GB of storage (versus 2 GB on Dropbox) and they encrypt your files in a way such that only you can see them. They also conveniently have an Android app. Create an account with Mega then when you click "Share" during the backup process you can save the PDF right to Mega. This way you will have access to it everywhere in case of emergency. </p>
<h2>Buying</h2>
<p>Most people who buy Bitcoin will buy from an exchange. There are a ton of different exchanges out there for you to use with each one requiring different amounts of personal information. I personally have only used <a href="https://campbx.com/">Camp BX</a>. They allow for buying via USPS money orders or bank transfers. </p>
<p>I received a pamphlet with one of my miner purchases and it promotes <a href="https://expresscoin.com">Express Coin</a>, <a href="https://coinmkt.com">CoinMKT</a>, and <a href="https://localbitcoins.com">Local Bitcoins</a>. Local Bitcoins allows for buying in person from sellers using cash. It is well established with a lot of sellers. I have no experience with the other two but they seem to be good. The exchange you use is really up to you. Do some Google searches and try and find what you think is the best for you. To get you started also look at Bitstamp, BtcE, and Coinbase. </p>
<p>If you are using Mycelium you will notice a section on the main page for buying/selling bitcoins. This allows you to connect with local sellers to either buy or sell. If you do not want to give personal information to exchange services this is the way to go. Prices are typically slightly higher  but it is worth it. </p>
<p>That is it! Buy in or sell some goods and you are on your way to becoming an expert Bitcoin junky. </p>
