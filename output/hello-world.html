    <h1 class="title"> Hello World</h1>
    <p class=date> Mar 08, 2014 </p>
    <p>Hello world! I finally went and bought my domain name and a VPS. I was hesitant at first but it was totes worth it. </p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<h3>Server space</h3>
<p>I bought the $5/month Virtual Private Server (VPS) plan from <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>. They market it as being ready to go in 55 seconds. It took about a minute for mine, so that's definitely accurate! DigitalOcean is awesome, so if you want a VPS for your own website, use them.</p>
<h3>Registrar</h3>
<p>Well every good website needs a domain name. No one wants to access one via an IP address. So I went to <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> and bought my domain name <em>seanmckaybeck.com</em> for $10.69 a year. It was a very simple checkout process, and they even included a free Whois Guard!! For those who don't know what that means, <code>whois</code> is a service/command to look up information about a domain name and normally the owner's address, phone number, and email are attached to the record. I don't know about you, but I don't want some creep looking up my address with ease. Whois Guard prevents that information from being attached to the record, and instead it puts fake information in for you. The registrar (Namecheap in my case) still has that information, but it isn't publicly available. Thank you Namecheap!</p>
<h3>The blog</h3>
<p>This blog is powered by <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a>. It is a minimalistic blogging platform. I like it because it focuses on content delivery rather than bells and whistles. It's easy to install new themes, which you can get for free on the <a href="http://marketplace.ghost.org/">Ghost marketplace</a>, so focusing on what you say is simple. You write in Markdown which makes it easy to style your posts while you write. If you want to use HTML in your posts you can do that too (embedding videos, yadda yadda yadda)! </p>
<p>Basically, Ghost is awesome. And it's OPEN SOURCE! That may not mean much to you, but basically it means it is free for anyone to use (free as in freedom, but in Ghost's case it is also free to download the source code). So stop using Blogger. Everyone uses Blogger and their blogs look the same and bland. Switch to Ghost! You'll be glad you did. </p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>My writing skills have deteriorated since high school. I would like to fix that, and the best way to become a better writer is to write. This will help me in that endeavor. </p>
<p>Blogs are a great way of sharing information. I'm all about open access and shariing knowledge, and this will help me to do that. Sharing information inspires innovation and maybe I will be able to contribute to that. If not, well at least I tried!</p>
