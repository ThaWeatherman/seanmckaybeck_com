Summary: Overview of why Bitcoin isn't fully anonymous

Lots of people like to think Bitcoin is anonymous. When I first heard of it others marketed it to me as an anonymous currency. The reality is that Bitcoin is not anonymous. 

The currency itself is based on technology that provides a public ledger of every transaction that ever happens. Every transaction to and from any particular address can be seen easily. You can go to [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info) and watch transactions happening in real time. You can also go there and enter in any Bitcoin address you want and see all of its transaction history. 

It is easy to trick yourself into thinking that because transactions are tied to Bitcoin addresses they are not tied to you. Unless you are _**extremely**_ careful that is not true. 

There are multiple ways that your identity can be exposed when using Bitcoin. 

* In-person buying
* Exchanges
* Buying products from retailers 
* Posting an address for donations
* Buying services from others directly
* Using an online wallet
* The list goes on...

If you buy Bitcoin from an exchange they typically require information about who you are. Right when you buy your identity is compromised. That exchange knows who you are and exactly how much Bitcoin you have (from them).

If you buy a product online in Bitcoin from someone like Overstock now Overstock knows you and your address. After all, they need to know who and where to send the product to. Oh and they also know how much Bitcoin you have since you are sending right to them from your personal address.

If you are looking to hide how much Bitcoin you have from Big Brother or anyone else, good luck. There are methods which can help you transact anonymously, but most people do not use them or even know they exist. The Bitcoin protocol is not inherently anonymous. [Others](http://zerocash-project.org) are working to make it that way but for now it is not. Do not let the lack of anonymity sway you from buying I'm though. Bitcoin is the currency of the future and you will be sad you missed the boat.
