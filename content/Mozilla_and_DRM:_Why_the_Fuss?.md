Summary: Defending Mozilla

I am just as anti-DRM (Digital Rights Management) as the next person but I really do not understand why there has been so much of an outcry against Mozilla for allowing DRM to creep into its product. At first I was mad because DRM goes against everything Mozilla values, but then I read the posts from [Mitchell Baker](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/05/14/drm-and-the-challenge-of-serving-users/) (Mozilla's executive chairwoman) and [Andreas Gal](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/05/reconciling-mozillas-mission-and-w3c-eme/) (Mozilla's CTO). 

The DRM is the Encrypted Media Exchange (EME). Video playing sites like Netflix and Hulu use this to send video data to users' browsers. The browsers require what is called a Content Decryption Module (CDM) to decrypt the video data and play it back to the user. Mozilla is adding a CDM made by Adobe into the Firefox browser to keep up with the other main browsers like Chrome. The CDM is of course proprietary which is contrary to Mozilla's open source business model. 

The truth is, users want to watch video. Users want to watch Netflix and Hulu because there really are not a lot of better options. If Firefox did not allow viewing this content users would switch to other browsers. If Firefox had no users then Mozilla would lose its main product and it would die off. 

The way Mozilla is building the CDM into Firefox is the best option possible (excluding the removal of the need for CDMs from all browsers). It is completely optional for users to install, like Flash. If a user does not want the DRM in its browser then the user does not have to install it. If the user does install it, the CDM is downloaded then sandboxed in a way that can prevent the tracking of the user across multiple sites. It does not have access to data about the user's computer or the user itself besides the unique identifier generated for the user on a per-site basis. 

I really cannot think of a better option that still will keep users from leaving Firefox. No user wants DRM, but at the moment DRM is the only option. All we can do is continue the fight to rid the world of DRM. Until then this is the best option for Firefox.
