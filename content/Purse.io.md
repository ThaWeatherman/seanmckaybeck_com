Summary: Impressions on the service from purse.io

One thing preventing Bitcoin from going completely mainstream is ease of purchasing. Most people are too impatient to wait for wire transfers, which currently is the main method of paying for Bitcoin. Others are too lazy to find a seller on a site like [Local Bitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com). If the person is not too lazy for that, then he most likely will be too lazy to go to a bank of the seller's choosing and deposit cash. 

People use credit cards for everything. Very few people carry cash on themselves anymore, and if they do it is a relatively small amount. But credit card transactions are easily reversible. This is dangerous for Bitcoin sellers as Bitcoin transactions are not reversible. A buyer could purchase with a credit card, receive his bitcoins, then reverse the transaction leaving the seller empty-handed. 

## A Solution?

Enter [Purse.io](https://purse.io). Purse.io has been around since the end of 2013. It allows for buying Bitcoin with your credit card and buying items on Amazon with Bitcoin for a fraction of the original price! Yes you heard me right: you can buy from Amazon at discounted prices. Their introduction video explains it quite well.

It serves a specific purchase that many Bitcoiners have wanted for a long time: buying with Bitcoin on Amazon. It also is easy for new users as it only requires an Amazon account - which most people have - and a credit card! The downside for buyers is you purchase Bitcoin at an increased price compared to the average exchange price. However it is easy and does not take very long to do. It requires no verification on [Purse.io](https://purse.io) either. Just sign up and you are ready to go. 

## Buying Bitcoin

Buying was straightforward. Navigate to the Buy BTC area via the sidebar on the left. You can change the buy orders shown on the page via the options at the top. I found a US-based buy order for a small amount of money and hit purchase. A screen popped up with a button to add the sellers wishlist to my Amazon cart. It really was just one click on Amazon as stated in the introduction video. I ordered the item ([this one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OVWQDA/ref=ox_ya_os_product_refresh_T1)) and entered the order number back on Purse.io. It really was a simple process. The only part that took time was waiting for Amazon to ship the item so I could enter a tracking number for the item. 

Amazon estimated it would take a week to ship the item but it only took a day. As soon as delivery was finished the seller confirmed receiving the item and Purse.io released the bitcoins from escrow. 

## Selling Bitcoin

I unfortunately bought Bitcoin with an item that required more than two days for shipping. I was impatient so instead of waiting to use the Bitcoin from my buy order I just deposited some of my own. The My Wallet page discloses your account's bitcoin address. 

Purse.io did not make me wait for the full deposit transaction to go through before stating that my funds were available for use, which was convenient for me from a time perspective. After one confirmation the funds were ready to use. 

Setting up my sell order (spend as they call it on Purse.io) was easy. I created a new wish list on Amazon with The Art of War and Beyond Fear on it, updated it to include my shipping address, then copied the share link to the sell order set up page. It took less than two minutes. Purse.io easily processed the wish list and took me to the screen for setting the discount percentage. I wanted someone to buy quickly so I set the discount as 10% and hit submit.

Waiting for a buyer sucks because I want my books now! However because my order was so small and the discount was only 10% I had a buyer within 8 minutes. 

It took a little longer than expected to get the books, but that was Amazon's fault, but I got them as desired! I confirmed delivery and that was it. I was done with buying my first items from Amazon using Bitcoin.

## Other Things I Noticed

As I used the service there were some additional things I liked as well as a couple bugs I found. 

### Bugs, etc.

After finishing a purchase Purse.io gives you the option to tweet about finishing the purchase. Clicking "Tweet" takes you to the Twitter page for sharing a tweet, but the link provided links to your account through "accounts/me" or something of that nature. It would be nice if there were some context such as "I just bought from Amazon using Bitcoin! https://purse.io". This is not really a bug, but it would make the feature better.

Unfortunately I did not take a screenshot of this issue, but in a transaction page when you are buying Bitcoin there is a button to cancel the transaction. The rest of the row of the page the button appears on is just white space and should not serve any purpose. However when you click anywhere in that white space the window to confirm canceling the transaction comes up. This should only happen when the actual button is pressed.

I was disappointed when I was buying the books that the other person could not submit the tracking information. Amazon hid the tracking number for privacy, but the tracking number never got to me either. As a result I had no idea when my packages were going to arrive. This issue presents itself from Amazon's end, but Purse.io has a feature for adding the tracking number to an order in case they do happen to give a tracking number. According to Purse.io they can still track the order without the tracking number for shipping, but it would be nice if the user could as well in these situations. 

### Nice Features

The user interface is nice. It is easy to navigate the site and the colors do not pop out and blind me (I am not a huge fan of bright colors). They allow for two-factor authentication which is awesome. They do not require you to use your real information on Purse.io. They also display your total amount of Bitcoin in mBTC which I love. It is easier to say 20 mBTC instead of 0.02 BTC in my opinion and this allows for making sense of smaller transactions. They also have a chat feature within an order so you can interact with the other party. This is helpful in situations where you cannot see tracking information but the other person can at least see if the item has shipped. Finally, their customer support is fairly responsive. I interacted a fair amount with their Twitter account with questions and they responded quickly. 

## Final Thoughts

Overall it was a positive experience buying and selling on [Purse.io](https://purse.io). The amount of time to wait before receiving bitcoins or buying bitcoins varies because of the different shipping times for items on Amazon. However it is easier for new users than setting up an account on an exchange and getting verified. It is also more convenient to use a credit card on your Amazon account than it is to use a wire transfer. Purse.io satisfies a niche desire quite well and will hopefully bring more users to the world of Bitcoin. It will also hopefully encourage Amazon to start accepting Bitcoin for payment.
