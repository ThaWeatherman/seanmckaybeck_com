Summary: My reasons behind mining Bitcoin, even if it isn't very profitable at the moment

That is my fairly simple mining setup. Two BFL Jalapenos, four Block Erupters, and five AntMiner U2s. I regret buying the Block Erupters because my AntMiners (2 GH/s) cost less per unit than the Block Erupters (336 MH/s). I really should have waited for them to drop back down in price. They are all attached to a Raspberry Pi. In total I am getting about 28 GH/s. At the current difficulty I am getting about 0.01 BTC every week, which really is not much at all. So why put all the effort into buying these and setting them up? 

Bitcoin needs miners to work. Without miners the blockchain would be a failure and no payments could ever go through! The currency would fall apart. I like to think my meager setup is helping someone somewhere make a transaction. When no more coins are released into the market and the big dog miners leave the small timers like me will keep on going! Any contribution of hashing to the network is beneficial. 

I am a nerd and I find this technology fascinating. As a result I like to show it off. Doing this opens up doors to talk about Bitcoin and get others interested in it. Bitcoin cannot thrive until it has more adopters and discussing it with anyone and everyone will bring more people to it! Mining has the benefit of confirming transactions and educating others about the currency. Once the currency gains widespread adoption its value will increase and everyone can experience the benefits of a decentralized currency.
