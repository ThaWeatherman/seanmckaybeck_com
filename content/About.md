See me on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/thaweatherman) to verify who I am and find my PGP info. 

As the URL tells you, my name is Sean. I am currently working towards a Masters in Security Informatics at Johns Hopkins University. I have a particularly strong interest in cryptography, although anything security-oriented gets me fired up. You can see what I'm currently working on in my free time or a more-information-than-needed resume at [Github](https://github.com/ThaWeatherman) and [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/seanmckaybeck/). If you want me to help out on a project feel free to email me.

I am a big believer in the need for patent and copyright reform. I also believe defending an open and free internet is key to promoting innovation. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is the leader in these causes. Click below to learn more about the EFF and why their organization is awesome.
